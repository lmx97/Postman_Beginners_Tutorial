In this case the client is postman and the server or the api is the simple books API. And we are using http messages, the http message that goes from postman to the api is called a request and what is coming back from the api is the response.

*The request in postman is represented on the upper part.*

Postman allows you to configure many things about the request. The request will contain the url or the address and also the request method. We can  specify the headers and body.

*The response in postman is represented on the lower part.*

The response contains some properties such as status code.
