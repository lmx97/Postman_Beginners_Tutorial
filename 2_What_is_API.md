### What is API ?

API stands for Application Programming Interface (API). It acts like an interface between a couple of applications and establishes a connection between them. 

An API is a collection of agreements, functions, and tools that an application can provide to its users for successful communication with another application. We require an API whenever we access an application like checking news over the phone, Facebook, and so on.
